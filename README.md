# Scripting in Swift

In this repo, you’ll find the Swift sources demonstrated in the Scripting in Swift [post](https://yakovmanshin.com/2023/08/scripting-in-swift/) and [video](https://youtu.be/WIhaZmZiEEg) (with very minor corrections).

Don’t forget to make the script files executable if you want to run them:

```shell
chmod +x HelloWorld.swift
```
